# CDSW_Tools
A set of useful tools for the Community Data Science Workshop run at UW.

## Applicant-check tools
We wanted a way for applicants to be able to check that they're accepted or declined from the workshop,
so in true keeping with a project that's all about using python, I wrote a basic tool (that will have a
website attached to it shortly) to check if a given person is accepted or declined from a given session
of the workshop.
